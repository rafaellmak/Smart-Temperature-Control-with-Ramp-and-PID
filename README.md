Description:
This project aims to develop a smart temperature control system using a MAX6675 temperature sensor, Raspberry Pi, and a relay module. The system is designed to maintain precise temperature control with the ability to create temperature ramps and utilize a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for optimal performance.
Features:
Temperature Sensing: The MAX6675 is a high-precision digital thermocouple sensor capable of measuring temperatures up to 1024Â°C. It provides accurate temperature data used for control.
Relay Control: A GPIO pin (configurable) is connected to a relay module, allowing the system to control a heating element or any other temperature-altering device.
PID Control: The PID controller is used to adjust the heating element based on the difference between the desired temperature (setpoint) and the current temperature. It considers the proportional, integral, and derivative terms for precise control.
Temperature Ramping: The system supports temperature ramping, allowing you to create smooth transitions from one temperature to another. You can configure up to three setpoints for the desired temperature profile.
Software Components:
The software components of this project are implemented as a Linux kernel module, which makes it a versatile solution for various applications.
Linux Kernel Module:
The project includes a Linux kernel module that handles the following tasks:
Temperature Reading: The module reads temperature data from the MAX6675 sensor via SPI communication. It uses a pre-defined SPI configuration for this purpose.
PID Control: The module implements a PID controller with user-configurable gains (Kp and Ki) to maintain the desired temperature. It continuously adjusts the relay output for precise temperature control.
Ramping Control: The module allows you to specify temperature setpoints, and it transitions between these setpoints smoothly over time, creating temperature ramps.
Relay Control: A GPIO pin is used to control a relay module, which, in turn, activates or deactivates the heating element based on the PID controller's output.
Error Handling: The module includes error handling for sensor communication, GPIO control, and SPI setup, ensuring robust operation.
Usage:
This project is highly adaptable and can be integrated into various temperature control applications, such as sous-vide cooking, laboratory equipment, or industrial processes that require precise temperature control.
Customization:
The code can be easily customized to accommodate different GPIO pin configurations, relay modules, PID parameters, and temperature setpoints.
Conclusion:
This smart temperature control project offers a flexible and powerful solution for maintaining precise temperature control with support for temperature ramping. Whether you need to maintain a specific temperature for cooking, experiments, or industrial processes, this system provides a reliable and efficient solution.
